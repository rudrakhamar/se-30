1)What is software? What is software engineering?

A)Software is a program or set of programs containing instructions that provide desired functionality. Engineering is the process of designing and building something that serves a particular purpose and finds a cost-effective solution to problems.

Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.

Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies, including requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance.
It is a rapidly evolving field, and new tools and technologies are constantly being developed to improve the software development process.
By following the principles of software engineering and using the appropriate tools and methodologies, software developers can create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software that meets the needs of its users.
Software Engineering is mainly used for large projects based on software systems rather than single programs or applications.





2)Explain the types of software ?

A)1) System Software :

- provides the basic functions for computer usage and helps to run the computer hardware
and system.
- is the s/w used by the computer to translate inputs from various sources into a language
which a machine can understand.
- Basically OS coordinates the different hardware components of a computer.
- Ex. Linux, window, macOS, Android, iOS

2)Application Software:
- is the general designation of computer programs for performing user tasks.
- Types of application software
 Mobile app:
- Application that run on mobile
- Ex. Instagram, facebook, etc

3)What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC?

A) SDLC is a structure imposed on the development of a software product that defines the
process for planning, implementation, testing, documentation, deployment, and ongoing
maintenance and support. There are a number of different development models.
 A Software Development Life Cycle is essentially a series of steps, or phases, that
provide a model for the development and lifecycle management of an application or piece
of software.

-1. Requirements gathering and analysis: This phase involves gathering information about the software requirements from stakeholders, such as customers, end-users, and business analysts.

2. Design: In this phase, the software design is created, which includes the overall architecture of the software, data structures, and interfaces. It has two steps: High-level design (HLD): It gives the architecture of software products.Low-level design (LLD). It describes how each and every feature in the product should work and every component.
3. Implementation or coding: The design is then implemented in code, usually in several iterations, and this phase is also called as Development.
4. Testing: The software is thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works correctly.

5. Deployment: After successful testing, The software is deployed to a production environment and made available to end-users.

6. Maintenance: This phase includes ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to the software.

4)What is DFD? Create a DFD diagram on Flipkart?

A)A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a traditional way to visualize the information flows
within a system. A neat and clear DFD can depict a good amount of the system requirements
graphically. It can be manual, automated, or a combination of both.
It shows how information enters and leaves the system, what changes the information and
where information is stored. The purpose of a DFD is to show the scope and boundaries of a
system as a whole. It may be used as a communications tool between a systems analyst and any
person who plays a part in the system that acts as the starting point for redesigning a system.

5)What is Flow chart? Create a flowchart to make addition of two numbers?

A)A flowchart is a graphical representation of a process, showing the steps or activities involved and the sequence in which they occur. It typically uses standardized symbols to represent different actions, decisions, inputs, outputs, and other elements within the process. Flowcharts are widely used in various fields such as software development, engineering, business management, and education to visually illustrate complex processes, aid in understanding, and facilitate communication among stakeholders.

6)What is use case diagram? Create a use-case on bill payment on paytm?

A)A use case diagram is a type of diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that illustrates the relationships between actors (users or external systems) and use cases (functional requirements) within a system. It provides a high-level view of the system's functionality from the perspective of users or external entities.

Use case diagrams are valuable tools for understanding system requirements, identifying actors' roles and responsibilities, and communicating system functionality to stakeholders. They are commonly used during the requirements analysis phase of software development to capture and define user interactions with the system.
